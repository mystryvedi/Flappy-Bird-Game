# Flappy Bird Game



This is a Python implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game. Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The objective of the game is to navigate a bird, which moves continuously to the right, between sets of pipes without colliding with them.

The game has been implemented using the Pygame library for Python. The source code is available in this GitHub repository along with detailed instructions on how to install and run the game on your local machine.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The bird is controlled using the space bar, which causes the bird to flap its wings and rise. If the bird collides with a pipe, the game is over.

The game has a scoring system, which increases every time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes. The score is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen.
